git add .
git add *
git add filename 
git add *.java or any format (  move the file to workingarea(untrackedfile) to staggingarea(trackedfile))

workingarea(displays red colour)
staggingarea(Green colour)


git commit -m "first commit.." ( to commit the code at first time )( only in the stagging area file are to be commited.)(to local repo)
git commit -m added filename( to add the files)
git commit -a -m filename ( to add the file directly workingarea to local repo.......it is only for updated file ,
                                   this command is not applicable for new files)

git remote add <aliasname for Url> repository Url (realtime senario we can use only SSH url)


git push <aliasname> groupname (master is default group name)


git log (to check logs where you push to repo)
ex:git log -2 ( it shows only last two commit logs)

git show <commit Id> (it shows detials of that id)
git show --pretty="" --name-only <commitid> (it shows only filename)


git reset ( it will getback all the files staggingarea to workingarea )
git reset <filename> ( it will getback only that specific named file staggingarea to workingarea)

git revert <commitid> ( to delete newfiles that you commited...... this will only delete updated content )
